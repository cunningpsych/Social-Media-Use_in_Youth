# Social-Media-Use_in_Youth

This is a repository for a project examining youth social media use and the behavioral and mental health outcomes of impulsivity, depression, and anxiety.

The purpose of this project is to run through some reproducible research workflows rather than fully address a specific scientific question, although it could potentially be useful for that purpose in the future. Due to this, the resulting findings were bleak and showed near-negligible relationships between how much an adolescent uses social media and their levels of impulsivity, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, no significant differences were found between how eighth-grade and tenth-grade participants scored on each measure.

A data dictionary and corresponding simulated dataset can be found within the 'Data' folder of this repository. The final report and associated references can be found in the 'Reports' folder, and all previous versions of the project can be found in 'Archives.' To work with the simulated dataset and Rmd file, the pathway for the data set will need to match that of the repository, or the code to read in the data will need to be edited.

Pull requests are welcome, but please communicate before making any changes to the project.

This README will be updated as the project progresses.
