# Social-Media-Use_in_Youth

This is a repository for a project examining youth social media use and the psychopathology outcomes of impulse control, depression, and anxiety.

The purpose of this project is to run through some reproducible research workflows rather than fully address a specific scientific question, although it could potentially be useful for that purpose in the future.

The project presently includes a data dictionary, simulated dataset, and a drafted report.

This README will be updated as the project progresses.
